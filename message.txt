Dear NAME,

This is an automatic notification that you have a SOMETHING in 30 minutes.
Please arrive promptly at your designated time and sign out at the end of your hour with your initials and the number of students that attended at the peak of your hour. The sign out sheet should be next to the entrance, if not please notify the preceptors.

Thank you,

Alex and Minghao
